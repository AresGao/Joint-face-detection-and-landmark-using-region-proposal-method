# R-MTCNNï¼šJoint Face detection and Alignment using Region-based Multi-task Convolution Networks
Codes and paper will release soon.

> R-MTCNN is an excellent multi-task face detection and alignment framework, robust to extreme conditions such as large pose, light and occlusion, and both the performance of face detection and face alignment are higher than that of [MTCNN](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1604/1604.02878.pdf).
