# R-MTCNN：Joint Face detection and Alignment using Region-based Multi-task Convolution Networks
This is the work I have done with  [Ruimin Chen](https://github.com/RuiminChen) during my internship in [TopPlus](http://www.topplusvision.com/).Codes and paper will release soon.

> R-MTCNN is an excellent multi-task face detection and alignment framework, robust to extreme conditions such as large pose, light and occlusion, and the performance of face detection and face alignment are higher than that of MTCNN.
